## try to porting [ATmega-Transistor-Tester](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR_Transistortester)  to arduino platform.
### in this matter i took inspiration from the following projects:
* [NanOMeter 2020](https://www.protowrxs.com/index.php/2020/01/01/nanometer-2020/)
* [AVR Transistor Tester](https://www.instructables.com/AVR-Transistor-Tester/)
* [FAB-Smart-Meter](https://github.com/ajithkmg/FAB-Smart-Meter)
